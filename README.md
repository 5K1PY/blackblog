This is my personal blog where I will publish mainly: 

- Universiry lecture notes
- Articles about software development
- reflexions of my opinions
- and maybe some philosofical stuff

Main purpose of this blog is my own effort to learn how to write and give others (hopefuly) something interesting to read.


# About me

I am a Czech highschool student. My interests are software development, Mathematics, Theology and philosophy. In my free time I try to write lyrical stuf, but I am not self-confident enought to publish anything yet. I also love to attend metal or hardcore concerts, ski and travel.
